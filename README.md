Network

For running project:
  1. git clone https://github.com/Pavlovich-kll/Network.git (from master)
  2. docker-compose up

Next, you need to register the user: {{base_url}}/auth/user/register
and 
log in: {{base_url}}/auth/login

After authorization we will have a token that needs to be used for subsequent requests.

Network

For running project:

git clone https://github.com/Pavlovich-kll/Network.git (from master)
docker-compose up
Next, you need to register the user: {{base_url}}/auth/user/register and log in: {{base_url}}/auth/login

After authorization we will have a token that needs to be used for subsequent requests.
